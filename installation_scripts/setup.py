Script: setup.py

This script automates the setup process for the PM209 dataset used in the manual assistant application. It performs the following tasks:

1. Downloads a ZIP archive of the PM209 dataset from Google Drive.
2. Extracts the archive to a local folder.
3. Copies all manual image subfolders to a local docs/ directory.
4. Downloads and saves the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model from the SentenceTransformers library.
5. Cleans up intermediate files and folders from the setup process.

Usage:
    python setup.py

Side Effects:
    - Creates the following directories (removing them if they already exist):
        - docs/: populated with manual image folders
        - models/: containing the downloaded embedding model
        - vector_databases/: removed during cleanup if present
    - Downloads a ZIP file (PM209.zip) and deletes it after extraction.

Note:
    This script is meant to be run as a standalone utility. It is not intended for import as a module.
