Script: evaluate_manuals.py

This script evaluates the performance of the assistant on a random subset of manuals
by generating and saving evaluation DataFrames for each manual using the Evaluator class.

Workflow:
    1. Retrieves all available manual names from the 'vector_databases/' directory.
    2. Randomly shuffles the manual list.
    3. Attempts to evaluate up to 100 manuals:
        - For each manual not yet evaluated (i.e., no .pkl file exists in 'evaluation/'),
          an Evaluator is instantiated.
        - The resulting evaluation DataFrame is saved as a .pkl file under 'evaluation/'.
        - Progress is shown via a tqdm progress bar.
    4. Reports the number of successful evaluations and total attempts at the end.

Usage:
    python evaluate_manuals.py

Side Effects:
    - Creates or updates files in the 'evaluation/' directory.

Note:
    The script is designed so that it can be run several times until all 209 manuals have
    been evaluated.

        - Saves the evaluation result to 'evaluation/<manual_name>.pkl'.
